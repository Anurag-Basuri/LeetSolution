# 📘 Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear structure consisting of vertices and edges. It models pairwise relations between objects.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Adjacency Matrix/List
- BFS/DFS
- Connected Components
- Cycle Detection
- Bipartite Check

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: BFS/DFS: O(V + E)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
