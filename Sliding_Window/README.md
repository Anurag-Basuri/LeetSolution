# 📘 Sliding Window

Sliding Window is a technique to optimize problems involving subarrays or substrings by maintaining a window of elements.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Fixed Size Window
- Variable Size Window
- Shrinkable Window
- Hash Map with Window

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Time: O(n) | Space: O(1) or O(k)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
