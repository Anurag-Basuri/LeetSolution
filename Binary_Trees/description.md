A Binary Tree Data Structure is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is commonly used in computer science for efficient storage and retrieval of data, with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Binary tree is a tree data structure(non-linear) in which each node can have at most two children which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 

The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and the bottom-most nodes are called leaves. A binary tree can be visualized as a hierarchical structure with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom.

Representation of Binary Tree
Each node in a Binary Tree has three parts:

Data,
Pointer to the left child,
Pointer to the right child
