# 📘 Binary Trees

A Binary Tree is a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children. It's the basis for BSTs, Heaps, and Tries.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- DFS (Pre/In/Post)
- BFS (Level Order)
- Height/Depth
- Diameter
- LCA

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Traversal: O(n) | Space: O(h)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
