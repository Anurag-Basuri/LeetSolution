# 📘 Arrays

An array is a linear data structure collecting elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. It's fundamental for building other data structures.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Prefix Sum
- Kadane's Algorithm
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Sorting
- Binary Search

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Access: O(1) | Search: O(n) | Insert/Delete: O(n)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
