# 📘 Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where the left child is smaller and the right child is greater than the parent node.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Inorder Traversal (Sorted)
- Insertion/Deletion
- Balancing (AVL/Red-Black)
- LCA in BST

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Search/Insert/Delete: O(h) where h is height (O(log n) balanced, O(n) skewed)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
