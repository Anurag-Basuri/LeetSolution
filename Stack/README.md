# 📘 Stack

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end (top).

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Push/Pop Operations
- Monotonic Stack
- Expression Parsing
- Parentheses Matching
- Next Greater/Smaller Element

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis

- **Complexity**: Push: O(1) | Pop: O(1) | Peek: O(1)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips

- Use stack for problems involving nested structures (parentheses, HTML tags).
- Monotonic stacks help find next greater/smaller elements in O(n).
- Consider stack when you need to process elements in reverse order.
