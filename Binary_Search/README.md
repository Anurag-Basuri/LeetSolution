# 📘 Binary Search

Binary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that locates a value in a sorted sequence by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Lower Bound
- Upper Bound
- Search Answer Space
- Rotated Sorted Array

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Time: O(log n) | Space: O(1)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
