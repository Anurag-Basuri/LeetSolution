# 📘 Shortest Path Algo

Algorithms designed to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (Non-negative weights)
- Bellman-Ford (Negative weights)
- Floyd-Warshall (All-pairs)

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Dijkstra: O(E log V)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
