# 📘 Two Pointer

Two Pointers is a technique used to search for pairs or iterate structures (arrays/lists) usually to optimize time complexity.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Opposite Direction (Sum types)
- Same Direction (Fast/Slow)
- Partitioning
- Merging

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
