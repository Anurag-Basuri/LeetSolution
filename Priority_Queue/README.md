# 📘 Priority Queue

A Priority Queue is an abstract data type where each element has a priority. Elements are served based on priority (Heaps).

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Min-Heap / Max-Heap
- K-th Largest/Smallest
- Median from Data Stream
- Merge K Lists

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Insert/Extract: O(log n) | Peek: O(1)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
