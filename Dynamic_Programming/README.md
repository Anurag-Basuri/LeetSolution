# 📘 Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique that solves complex problems by breaking them into simpler overlapping subproblems.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Memoization (Top-Down)
- Tabulation (Bottom-Up)
- Knapsack Pattern
- LCS/LIS Patterns

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Time: O(States × Transitions) | Space: O(States)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
