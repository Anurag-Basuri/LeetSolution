# 📘 Matrix

Matrix problems involve operations on 2D arrays (grids). Common in graph traversals and DP.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Grid Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Matrix Rotation
- Spiral Order
- DP on Grids

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Traversal: O(R × C)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
