Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N). 

To Solve:- To solve any problem in binary search, we need to understand that this algorithm works on eliminating things. Therefore we have to figure out such a condition through which we can eliminate.
