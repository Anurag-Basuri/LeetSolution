# 📘 Linked List

A Linked List is a linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next. It allows efficient insertion and deletion.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Reversal
- Dummy Node
- Merge Two Lists
- Cycle Detection

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Access: O(n) | Insert/Delete: O(1) (at known position)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
