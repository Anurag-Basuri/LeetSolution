# 📘 Topological Sort

Topological Sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every edge u->v, u comes before v.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Kahn's Algorithm (BFS)
- DFS Approach
- Cycle Detection in DAG
- Dependency Resolution

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Time: O(V + E)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
