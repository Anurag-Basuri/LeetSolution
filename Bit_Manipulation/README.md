# 📘 Bit Manipulation

Bit Manipulation involves applying logical operations on bit patterns. It's crucial for optimization and low-level programming.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- XOR Properties
- Bit Masking
- Shifting (<<, >>)
- Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

## ⚙️ Complexity Analysis
- **Complexity**: Operations: O(1)

## 📝 Common Patterns & Tips
- Identify the problem constraints.
- Choose the data structure that best fits the operations (access vs. search vs. update).
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates).
